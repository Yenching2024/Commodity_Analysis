# Commodity Analysis


This is a space for my various projects analyzing all things commodities.

The projects in the repo will be mostly market/price analysis, but also might include some international trade or hard commodity
production (especailly metals/minerals). As with my academic interests, I've got a particular concentration on the East Asian/Chinese market.


Generally code with Python, using SQL for database access. Right now most comfortable using Scikit-Learn as far as ML goes, but excited to 
implement more ML packages soon. 



目前我对 Scikit-Learn 最舒适，但期待我使用别的机器学习packages！
